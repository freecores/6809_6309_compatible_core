05.01.14
--------

- MC6809_cpu.v : fixed exg (wrong source), implemented SYNC

01.01.14
--------

- alu16.v : the alu has been bronken in two units
- MC6809_cpu.v : added CWAI states and decoding
- decodres.v : added CWAI decoding

31.12.13
--------

- Implemented TFR/EXG
- MC6809_cpu.v: Added one more state to execute TFR or EXG
- decoders.v: added source/dest for TFR and EXG
- regblock.v : added second write path to the registers for TFR&EXG
- defs.v defined new SEQ_TFREXG for tfr&exg execution

30.12.13
--------

- Fixed increment/decrement of the stack pointer

- MC6809_cpu.v: Push/pull increment/decrement the stack pointr in their own states
                Added eamem source to the left alu data path to check for zero in the ea (leax/leay)

29.12.13
--------

- Fixed wrong byte in SEQ_MEM_WRITE_H
- Fixed unaffected Z flag for LEAX/LEAY
- Moved increment of pc from FETCH_2 to FETCH_1
- Fixed CMPA/CMPB/CMPX, they don't write a register back
- Fixed late write of pc

- decoders.v: Merged separated write_dest_x into one wire
              Added a source_size wire to indicate the width of the source argument
              Added the recognition of LEA as an alu mnemonic to modify the Z flag for LEAX/LEAY

- MC6809_cpu.v: Dropped checks for source size from the individual states and moved 
                into SEQ_MEM_READ_H
                Merged write flags into k_dest_write

- alu.v: Added a LEA instruction for LEAX/LEAY where only the Z flag will be affected

- defs.v : added a LEA define to the ALU section
